# coders-site-alt-prototype / mtkacodersunite.github.io
This used to be an alternate prototype, but now is the main website for Coders Unite. 

## The Website Base
Based on Bootstrap; uses the narrow-jumbotron example as a base with lots of changes.

## What does it do?
Our goals for the project are that it advertises the Coders club, that it displays profiles on the members who wish to share their information, and that it acts as a group portfolio for our work. 

## Can I help?
You can certainly make a pull request if you have any ideas, however we'd prefer that (unless you are a member of the group) you refrain from editing any of the text, because that is custom to the group. 

## When do you plan on finishing the Coder's Unite website?
Sometime soon, as long as it flies along at this pace. We really don't have a formal development schedule. 

## What's the license?
Apache License 2.0. Check out the license info in the repo (creatively titled "LICENSE").
